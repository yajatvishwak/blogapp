Want to start programming and have no clue how to start? 
Programming can be intimidating if you are just starting. In this post, I would try my best to give you an idea of how the field is
aligned and what puzzle pieces, go where.
Alright, Programming, as described by Wikipedia,

> Computer programming  is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing task. 
Programming involves tasks such as- analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.




Woah woah woah, TMI!! (I bet you did not read that quote)

In simpler terms,

> Computer programming is a way of telling a computer how to do certain things by giving it instructions. These instructions are called programs. A person who writes instructions is a computer programmer. 
These instructions come in different languages; they are called programming languages
Sometimes programmers use special software, such as IDEs (integrated development environment), 
which have many features to help them to make programs, and sometimes they use simpler software, called a text editor, which only gives them a place to type. 
There are many types of programming languages.

Neat, eh?

<h1>Decision that shapes your future</h1>
Starting off programming, requires you to choose a field of interest at first. Whether you want to start developing web pages or you are more fascinated by an AI bot, defining your interest can bring down the broad spectrum of this world to something in your visible range.
Since there is a huge variety of fields out there, I hacked together a small chat bot which will give you a insight on which programming language to choose. <br></br>

<h2>Things you should know before starting off your programming journey</h2>

 1. <h3>Master your basics</h3>
	 Basics of any language is a vital part of your code. Things like loops and conditional statements make up how good your code is. Practicing is a way you can master this skill. This will also let you pick up any other language since the fundamentals of all languages are the same.



2.  <h3> You'll have to be as patient as a sage </h3>
	Coding does not take much of your time, "Debugging" does. Writing your code and compiling is the best feeling but that feeling vanishes into this air when you see a dirty red message, indicating you have committed a grave mistake. The debugging part requires you to go through the code again and again, correcting the mistakes, line by line. This could be a little frustrating because sometimes the mistake is a very small one but that might have kept you awake all night. So be prepared to sit on the computer, with a cup of coffee, scratching your head and asking questions like "HOW IS THIS WRONG?"or "HOW IS THIS NOT WORKING! *@!#$"

3. <h3>Do more</h3>
	You cannot learn everything. This field is under very rapid development. Thus, make an effort to learn how the system works. Doing more will keep you active and going. Dont be discouraged by downtimes and compile errors. It's just a phase, you'll figure it out, just hang in there.

4. <h3>Learn Algorithm</h3> 
After you have gained some experience doing projects, it is now time to move to algorithms. Algorithms constitute the core of computer science. It doesnâ€™t matter if you are doing web development or game development, you are always using algorithms to achieve the end-result.

5. <h3>Code documentation</h3>
Code documentations help you learn about the programming language or framework or library you are using. They are rich with information about that particular topic, and can help you learn faster! Get started slowly, and learn how to read code documentation. They can be intimidating at times, so always keep Google as your rescue boat.


You are good to go! Keep that curiosity burning and Welcome home! All the best and Happy learning :) Until next time!
