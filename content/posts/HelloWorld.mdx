I have a new **programming blog**, and you're looking at it! 
Welcome to my journey of learning technology (and other cool stuff).
My name is Yajat. At this time, I'm currently 2 months away from being able to "enjoy" the  liablilities of adulthood. (TL;DR I'm 17 yo).
I like to innovate and learn through experience. 

I love to code. Coding is that one thing that inspires me the most. It is challenging, refreshing and a nice way to not let your brain rust.

This is the place where I document my learnings and ideas in simple terms. 
I hope these blogs are a good read. 
Pardon my mistakes and Let's go.
