# Genetic Algorithm - Code Implementation - Part 3

The previous blog post explained the problem statement genetic algorithm solves. In this post, we shall look at the at how to make a python application to accomplish the equivalent.


### Step 1: Generation of Population
 We need to first generate a population of random strings of the same length as the target sentence which then evolve into the correct sentence (ie The target sentence). Each member (string) of the population will have 
 1.  a Phrase (genes)
 2. a "fitness" value i.e the correctness of the sentence when compared to the target sentence
 3.  ability to mutate
 4. ability to crossover with another member(string)  

Let's make a DNA class with the above functionality. To add genes or phrase, we do, 

    import random
    import string
    import math
    class DNA:
     
     def  generateRandomPhrase(self, n):
        letters = string.ascii_lowercase
        letters = letters +  '  '
        return  ''.join(random.choice(letters)  for i in range(n)) 
       
     def  generateRandomChar(self): # auxiliary function which we will use for mutation later
        letters = string.ascii_lowercase
        return random.choice(letters)
       
       
     def  calFitness(self, target):
        score =  0
        for a, b in  zip(self.phrase, target):
            if a == b:
                score = score +  1
        return  (score /  len(target)) # this is a vague way to check for fitness, other fitness functions could be used as well  eg monte carlo 
        
        
     def __init__(self, n , target):
        self.phrase = generateRandomPhrase()
        self.fitness = self.calFitness(target)
          
The above code will make an object factory(class)  of DNA with its own random phrase and fitness value. So now we can make a population of DNAs  just by,  

    population  =  [DNA(len(target), target)  for i in  range((num))]
 **Note** - `population` is an array of DNA and each DNA represents a random string or a member. `target`  is the correct sentence we wish to evolve to.


#### The crossing over of a DNA 👪
This is the ability of the DNA to crossover or combine with another DNA  and form a child DNA. The child DNA will have characteristics of both the parent DNAs. 

    def crossover(self, partner):
        child =  DNA(len(partner.phrase) 
        self.generateRandomPhrase(len(partner.phrase)))
        midpoint = math.floor(randint(0, len(partner.phrase)-1))
        child.phrase  = self.phrase[:midpoint]  + partner.phrase[midpoint:]
        return child
This function block returns a child DNA by randomly combing the two DNAs.

#### The Mutation ability ☣️
This ability of the DNA adds randomness to the DNA after crossing over, This step is not essential for problems like this one since it's on a very small scale, but as more and more complex problems surface, Mutation rate plays an important role in maintaining genetic diversity.
A mutation will occur only if a value is greater than the specified mutation rate. That value used for comparison is calculated randomly
After the mutation takes place, the previous phrase(or genes) is replaced with the new phrase( or genes) and the fitness is recalculated.
 

       def  mutate(self, mr, target):
            t =  '' # temp string
            for i in self.phrase:
                if random.random()  > mr: #random.random() returns a random value between 0 and 1
                t = t + self.generateRandomChar()
                else:
                t = t + i
            self.phrase  = t
            self.fitness  = self.calFitness(target)

Our DNA class looks like:

### Step 2. Defining Population 

At this stage, we have our Members of the population ready. Let's go ahead and make the population and define all other functionality for achieving genetic algorithm.

To make a population,

    class Population:
        def __init__(self, target, num, mr):
            self.population = [ DNA(len(target), target) for i in range (num) ] # num is the number of members
            self.target = target
            #ignore these for now, they are explained below as and when required
            self.matingPool  =  []
        self.generations  =  0
        self.mutationRate  = mr
        self.finished  =  False
        self.bphrase  =  ''

### Natural Selection ✔️
This is the process in which the model will choose the fittest i.e the most correct members of the population and add them to a pool (mating pool) where the crossover happens. The members with high correctness are more likely to enter the pool than ones with less fitness. This does not mean the ones with low fitness will not enter the mating pool, they do, but they are less likely. This is done to maintain genetic diversity and uniqueness.
For instance, 
DNA1 has a fitness of 34
DNA2 has a fitness of 70 
Then DNA1 has fewer chances to enter the mating pool, producing less wrong sentences in future generations.

   

     def  naturalSelection(self):
        self.matingPool  =  []
        f =  [i.fitness  for i in self.population]
        maxFitness =  max(f)
        fitness =  0
        n =  0
        for i in self.population:
        fitness = self.scale_number(i.fitness,  0, maxFitness,  0,  1)
        n = math.floor(fitness *  100)
        for j in  range(n):
        self.matingPool.append(i)


### Generation - Evolution of the model ⌛
In this process, we do the crossover and mutation process. The result of this is a new generation of (better) sentences.

   

     def  generate(self):
        nexpop =  []
        for i in range(len(self.population)):
            p1 = self.matingPool[randint(0, len(self.matingPool)-1)]
            p2 = self.matingPool[randint(0, len(self.matingPool)-1)]
            c = p1.crossover(p2)
            c.mutate(self.mutationRate,  self.target)
            nexpop.append(c) # append child to temp pop
        self.generations  = self.generations  +  1 # increment generations
        self.population  = nexpop # set the next pop to current pop


### Evaluation Process 📈
This part is to check how well the sentences are evolving and if we have reached the target sentence. 

    def  evaluate(self):
       f =  [i.fitness  for i in self.population] #i is a DNA object
        wr =  max(f)
        obj =  max(self.population,  key=attrgetter('fitness'))
        self.bphrase  = obj.phrase
        if wr ==  1:
            self.finished  =  True

#### And we are done!!!! (a little cosmetics left)  🎉
The code looks like:

### Step 3. Bring it to life

 Create a file called main.py and write these lines of codes to run the algorithm.

    from Population import Population
    target =  "all that gliters is not gold"
    popmax =  10000
    mutationRate =  2
    p =  Population(popmax, target, mutationRate)
    while  not(p.isFinished()): # infinte loop till the model has converged
        p.naturalSelection() # perform natural selection
        p.generate() # make a new generation
        p.evaluate() # evaluate generation
        print(p.getBest()) # prints the best sentence of the generation
    print("Generation: "  +  str(p.getGen()))
    print("Evolved Phrase: "  +  str(p.getBest()))
    print("Model Converged -- Evolved successfully")


**Output**

We see that it has successfully evolved itself to the target sentence in about a few seconds, successfully solving the problem we faced in Blog 2. :)
